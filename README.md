### Project Title
Bikeshare project

### Description
This Python code analyses city bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Based on your choices it will answer different interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Analysis is performed via an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Statistics Computed

**#1 Popular times of travel** (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

**#2 Popular stations and trip**

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**#3 Trip duration**

- total travel time
- average travel time

**#4 User info**

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
